# Flask Application Design: Vacation Trip Planner

## HTML Files:

**1. **`index.html`**:
   - Serves as the homepage for the application.
   - Contains a form where users can input their vacation preferences (e.g., dates, destination, activities, budget).
   - Includes a submit button to send the form data to a backend route.

**2. **`results.html`**:
   - Displays the vacation options matching the user's preferences.
   - Includes a list of potential destinations, with details like flight prices, hotel accommodations, and activity suggestions.
   - Provides an option for users to select their desired vacation package.

**3. **`confirmation.html`**:
   - Confirms the user's selected vacation package and provides them with a summary of their itinerary.
   - Includes a payment gateway to facilitate secure booking and payment.

## Routes:

**1. `/`**:
   - Maps to the homepage and renders the `index.html` file.

**2. `/submit_preferences`**:
   - Handles the form submission from the `index.html` file.
   - Accepts the user's vacation preferences as form data.
   - Calls a Python function to process the data and generate vacation options.
   - Redirects to the `results.html` page, passing the generated options as data.

**3. `/select_package`**:
   - Receives the user's selected vacation package from `results.html`.
   - Validates the user's input and ensures package availability.
   - Displays a confirmation page with the chosen package details.

**4. `/book_package`**:
   - Processes the user's payment information and securely books the selected vacation package.
   - Redirects to the `confirmation.html` page, displaying the final itinerary.
